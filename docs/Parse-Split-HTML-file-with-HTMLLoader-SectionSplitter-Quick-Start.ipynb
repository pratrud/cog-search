Standard Devices The ETF starts at $150 and goes down by $4/mo. for the term of the agreement for purchased Standard devices (includes non-smartphone devices that have SIM card, e.g., basic and quick messaging phones [QMPs], LaptopConnect cards, WHP, Mobile Internet Device, Mobile Hotspot, connected wearables, and tablets). To determine if equipment is an Advanced device, reference Understand Early Termination Fees. Declining ETFs may also be referred to as a Prorated ETF. How to Identify the ETF Rate For Telegence: From the Agreement tab, click Commitment. The ETF Rate displays on the Commitment window. To view the declining ETF schedule, click Additional Contract Details. For OPUS: Refer to Consumer Tab &gt; Billing and Payments &gt; View Early Termination Fee onthe OPUS Hub.  For CRU: Review the customer\\'s FAN profile to determine the applicable ETF policy and fee. If the Offer Element (OE) is listed in FaST, and a customer is charged an ETF, submit a correct charge adjustment to resolve. If a CRU line disconnects before the end of its initial line commitment (ILC), the CF is charged to the billing account.  Line CFs do not coincide with the national contract. Customers are not allowed to pick and choose when to use the ETF waivers.  ETF waivers are used in the order the actual cancellation is completed. For future dated cancellations, any requests processed prior to that date would impact the availability of the waivers. For Important Information and Troubleshooting see CRU section.

Contracted CRUs, attached to a FAN, are subject to a CF when cancelling service before completion of their contractual agreement, unless a CF waiver is specified in their ROME/FaST profile OE. Commitment Start Date The date that the subscriber\\'s contract for that line of service is in effect. Do not confuse this with the Agreement start date. Custom CF Schedule A specific dollar amount that differs from the standard CF amount. Designate a specific flat CF dollar amount at the agreement or FAN level (e.g., $300 instead of $325). This cannot be designated at the device or CTN level. Designate a declining CF schedule agreement (e.g., $350 that declines at $12 per month instead of $10 per month; $150 declines at $6 per month instead of $4). Custom CF Waiver Waive all CFs for subscribers under that FAN and/or agreement. Custom CF Waiver with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per contract year (e.g., the first 300 lines cancelled per year receive waivers). Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN and/or agreement level. While not necessarily part of the contract language, a customer may request CF waivers be allocated to one FAN or spread across multiple FANs (i.e., 300 on one FAN, or 150/100/50 on three FANs; additional FANs could be assigned zero waivers). Waive fee accumulator counters are reset annually on the OE effective date. ILC Subscribers ILC for a single CTN. OE Effective Date A user-defined field in ROME meant to reflect the CF effective date in the contract language. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. Use this date when resetting the Custom CF Waiver with max lines count each year. An OE effective date defaults to date the OE is created but it is not a required field in ROME and it can be changed. Systematically, OEs go into effect on the OE Trigger start date regardless of the OE effective date. OE Expiration Date A user-defined field in ROME. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. The date that an OE expires in ROME. OE Trigger Expiration Date The date an OE expires and stops functioning. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF Schedules/Waivers. OE Trigger Start Date The date that an OE is added and inherited to the FAN level. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF schedules and resetting the annual Max Line count. Waive all CF without Condition Waive all CF without Condition is the same as Custom CF Waiver. CF Schedule A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. The fee schedule is based on the OE Trigger date. Using the OE Trigger Date and OE Effective Date, TLG uses the following rules when determining the CF. Upon subscriber cancellation, each CTN\\'s CF is evaluated based on both rules:  The OE Trigger Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Trigger Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. The OE Effective Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. Example: If a CF Waiver OE has an effective date of February 1, 2017, then the CF is waived for any lines that activated or upgraded on or after February 1, 2017, regardless of their cancellation date. OE Trigger Date vs. OE Effective Date Grid OE Trigger Date OE Effective Date TLG uses the OE Trigger Date to establish the CF Schedule User defined field for CF Schedule meant to reflect the contract language (systematically TLG uses the Trigger Date). Hidden to end-users - Not visible in ROME or TLG OEs go into effect the date they are added, regardless of the OE Effective date indicated OE Effective Date defaults to today\\'s date but is not a required field in ROME and is changeable TLG maintains a history of previous schedules, but it is not visible to users. A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. For any CRU with a FAN where there is no CF Schedule defined, TLG uses the default-declining schedule. CF Waiver (Flat Waiver) CFs for subscribers who activate or upgrade after the date the waiver is added. Customers with CF waivers under their FAN and/or agreement receive the waiver regardless of the date they activated or upgraded. Example: If a CF waiver was added on June 1, 2017, a line activated May 31, 2017, would receive the same waiver as a line activated June 1, 2017. CF Waivers with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per agreement and/or FAN per contract year. Some Enterprise contracts have customized CF options as part of their contract, which allow a waiver of the CF for a limit of lines per contract. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows the total amount number of CF waivers the customer has received, the number they have used so far, and the number remaining. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line returns to their available waivers. CF Waivers with Max Lines is a specific type of Waiver OE. Generally, the OE name should indicate Waive Cancellation Fee for [XXX] CRU users per year. Waivers with Max Lines will waive the CF for a defined number of CTNs and then apply a CF to all remaining CTNs. Example: The first 10 users have their fees waived and the 11th cancellation and all additional lines are charged a CF. The line limit applies per year. The count is reset each year on the OF Effective Date. Waivers with Max Lines can be at the FAN level or Agreement level.  Max Lines per Year Agreement: The waiver is at the Agreement level, so you would search by the contract ID. Max Lines per Year Profile: The waiver is at the Profile level, so you would search by the FAN. When the MAX Lines condition is added to a FAN/agreement, all subscribers will be counted against the Max Lines value. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows:  Waive Max Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer is allowed. Used Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has used this year. Left Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has remaining this year To access the screen in TLG, use the following path: Topics &gt; Waiver Accumulator Info.  Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN/Profile level or Agreement level. Check FaST profile Offer Elements (OE) to determine the level settings: the Profile level or Agreement level Based on the OE criteria: \\uf0a7 If the waiver is at the Agreement level, search by the Agreement ID by entering the Agreement number into the Contract ID field of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG \\uf0a7 If the waiver is at the Profile level, search by the FAN ID by entering the FAN number into FAN ID of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG Click Get TLG uses the Waive CF OE Effective Date to perform the annual reset of the Max Line count. If a contract with Waiver with Max Lines is in effect for multiple years, no changes need to be made in ROME, and it resets in TLG at the annual anniversary of the OE Effective Date.  This means if the Waiver with Max Lines was set on June 21, 2015, and reset June 21, 2016, then it is reset again on June 21, 2017, assuming no changes have been made to the agreement. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line, returns to their available waiver.\",Unnamed: 1\\nTerm,Definition\\nCF,\"A CF, known as an ETF for Consumer accounts, is a fee charged for those who cancel service before completing the contractual agreement made with AT&amp;T at the time of activation or upgrade.

Not at this time; refer the customer to an AT&amp;T store. The Consumer wired channel\\'s rate plans and prices are based on the customer agreeing to a two-year commitment; however, customers may opt to purchase at full-retail price and no ETF will apply.\"\\n\"Puerto Rico Do Puerto Rico customers have a special rate of decline for ETF? We are no longer required to apply Puerto Rico specific ETF declining schedule amounts to $0 over the life of the contract; the Puerto Rico law that previously required this was amended in February 2018. As a result, we no longer perform any manual calculation for Puerto Rico ETF charges, and Puerto Rico customers are now subject to the normal ETF declining schedule. While AT&amp;T already declines ETFs, the current monthly rate ($10 for Advanced and $4 for Standard) did not satisfy the Puerto Rico law (Law 157 - 2013) requiring all wireless ETFs to decline evenly to $0. Declining ETF rates for Puerto Rico apply to all consumer and business customers with a new AT&amp;T wireless service contract. The ETF rates apply only to customers with a Puerto Rico CTN and billing address, not U.S. Virgin Island (USVI) customers. All mobility consumer customers have the same ETF ($325 for Advanced and $150 for Standard); the back-end process used for customers cancelling in Puerto Rico is no longer in effect.\"\\n\"CRU What happens if the customer thinks they should be getting a CF waiver, and they are not? Before denying an adjustment, reps check the company\\'s profile in FaST to determine if a customer\\'s contract has an OE that allows a waiver of ETFs. Refer the requestor to their Pricing Manager.\"\\n\"If the fee indicates $325 declining, and the customer believes it should be $175 declining, what happens if the customer believes the amount of the fee is incorrect? Explain to the customer the facts of their CF schedule. Review the commitment start date in TLG. The CF schedule that was in effect on the subscriber\\'s commitment start date determines which CF schedule applies.\"\\nWhat happens when a subscriber does a FAN Move and is the CF assessed based on OEs established on the old FAN or the new FAN? The CF is assessed based on the OEs established on the new FAN. The CF schedule that was in effect on the subscriber\\'s commitment start date determines which CF schedule applies.\\n\"Can one subscriber\\'s CF experience differ from another subscriber\\'s CF experience under the same FAN, and does the CF experience differ for existing customers vs. new customers?

One of the ways we do this is to offer you the industry's leading wireless handsets below their full-retail price when you sign a two-year service agreement. In the event you wish to cancel service before your two-year agreement expires, you agree to pay a prorated early termination fee as an alternative way to complete your agreement. Of course, if you prefer not to enter into a term commitment, we offer the same great selection of devices at their full retail price with no term commitment or ETF, as well as AT&amp;T PREPAID options.</i></p>\n",

      "<csv>\"ETF Types Advanced Devices Unless a higher fee is specified in your business agreement, the ETF starts at $325 and goes down by $10/mo. for the term of the agreement for Advanced category purchased devices (includes all smartphones purchased with a service agreement).  Standard Devices The ETF starts at $150 and goes down by $4/mo. for the term of the agreement for purchased Standard devices (includes non-smartphone devices that have SIM card, e.g., basic and quick messaging phones [QMPs], LaptopConnect cards, WHP, Mobile Internet Device, Mobile Hotspot, connected wearables, and tablets). To determine if equipment is an Advanced device, reference Understand Early Termination Fees. Declining ETFs may also be referred to as a Prorated ETF. How to Identify the ETF Rate For Telegence: From the Agreement tab, click Commitment. The ETF Rate displays on the Commitment window. To view the declining ETF schedule, click Additional Contract Details. For OPUS: Refer to Consumer Tab &gt; Billing and Payments &gt; View Early Termination Fee onthe OPUS Hub.  For CRU: Review the customer's FAN profile to determine the applicable ETF policy and fee. If the Offer Element (OE) is listed in FaST, and a customer is charged an ETF, submit a correct charge adjustment to resolve. If a CRU line disconnects before the end of its initial line commitment (ILC), the CF is charged to the billing account.  Line CFs do not coincide with the national contract. Customers are not allowed to pick and choose when to use the ETF waivers.  ETF waivers are used in the order the actual cancellation is completed. For future dated cancellations, any requests processed prior to that date would impact the availability of the waivers. For Important Information and Troubleshooting see CRU section.

Commitment Start Date The date that the subscriber's contract for that line of service is in effect. Do not confuse this with the Agreement start date. Custom CF Schedule A specific dollar amount that differs from the standard CF amount. Designate a specific flat CF dollar amount at the agreement or FAN level (e.g., $300 instead of $325). This cannot be designated at the device or CTN level. Designate a declining CF schedule agreement (e.g., $350 that declines at $12 per month instead of $10 per month; $150 declines at $6 per month instead of $4). Custom CF Waiver Waive all CFs for subscribers under that FAN and/or agreement. Custom CF Waiver with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per contract year (e.g., the first 300 lines cancelled per year receive waivers). Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN and/or agreement level. While not necessarily part of the contract language, a customer may request CF waivers be allocated to one FAN or spread across multiple FANs (i.e., 300 on one FAN, or 150/100/50 on three FANs; additional FANs could be assigned zero waivers).

CF Schedule A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. The fee schedule is based on the OE Trigger date. Using the OE Trigger Date and OE Effective Date, TLG uses the following rules when determining the CF. Upon subscriber cancellation, each CTN's CF is evaluated based on both rules:  The OE Trigger Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Trigger Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. The OE Effective Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. Example: If a CF Waiver OE has an effective date of February 1, 2017, then the CF is waived for any lines that activated or upgraded on or after February 1, 2017, regardless of their cancellation date. OE Trigger Date vs. OE Effective Date Grid OE Trigger Date OE Effective Date TLG uses the OE Trigger Date to establish the CF Schedule User defined field for CF Schedule meant to reflect the contract language (systematically TLG uses the Trigger Date). Hidden to end-users - Not visible in ROME or TLG OEs go into effect the date they are added, regardless of the OE Effective date indicated OE Effective Date defaults to today's date but is not a required field in ROME and is changeable TLG maintains a history of previous schedules, but it is not visible to users. A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. For any CRU with a FAN where there is no CF Schedule defined, TLG uses the default-declining schedule. CF Waiver (Flat Waiver) CFs for subscribers who activate or upgrade after the date the waiver is added. Customers with CF waivers under their FAN and/or agreement receive the waiver regardless of the date they activated or upgraded. Example: If a CF waiver was added on June 1, 2017, a line activated May 31, 2017, would receive the same waiver as a line activated June 1, 2017. CF Waivers with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per agreement and/or FAN per contract year. Some Enterprise contracts have customized CF options as part of their contract, which allow a waiver of the CF for a limit of lines per contract. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows the total amount number of CF waivers the customer has received, the number they have used so far, and the number remaining. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line returns to their available waivers. CF Waivers with Max Lines is a specific type of Waiver OE. Generally, the OE name should indicate Waive Cancellation Fee for [XXX] CRU users per year. Waivers with Max Lines will waive the CF for a defined number of CTNs and then apply a CF to all remaining CTNs. Example: The first 10 users have their fees waived and the 11th cancellation and all additional lines are charged a CF. The line limit applies per year. The count is reset each year on the OF Effective Date. Waivers with Max Lines can be at the FAN level or Agreement level.  Max Lines per Year Agreement: The waiver is at the Agreement level, so you would search by the contract ID. Max Lines per Year Profile: The waiver is at the Profile level, so you would search by the FAN. When the MAX Lines condition is added to a FAN/agreement, all subscribers will be counted against the Max Lines value. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows:  Waive Max Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer is allowed. Used Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has used this year. Left Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has remaining this year To access the screen in TLG, use the following path: Topics &gt; Waiver Accumulator Info.  Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN/Profile level or Agreement level. Check FaST profile Offer Elements (OE) to determine the level settings: the Profile level or Agreement level Based on the OE criteria:  If the waiver is at the Agreement level, search by the Agreement ID by entering the Agreement number into the Contract ID field of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG  If the waiver is at the Profile level, search by the FAN ID by entering the FAN number into FAN ID of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG Click Get TLG uses the Waive CF OE Effective Date to perform the annual reset of the Max Line count. If a contract with Waiver with Max Lines is in effect for multiple years, no changes need to be made in ROME, and it resets in TLG at the annual anniversary of the OE Effective Date.  This means if the Waiver with Max Lines was set on June 21, 2015, and reset June 21, 2016, then it is reset again on June 21, 2017, assuming no changes have been made to the agreement. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line, returns to their available waiver.\",Unnamed: 1\n",

While AT&amp;T already declines ETFs, the current monthly rate ($10 for Advanced and $4 for Standard) did not satisfy the Puerto Rico law (Law 157 - 2013) requiring all wireless ETFs to decline evenly to $0. Declining ETF rates for Puerto Rico apply to all consumer and business customers with a new AT&amp;T wireless service contract. The ETF rates apply only to customers with a Puerto Rico CTN and billing address, not U.S. Virgin Island (USVI) customers.

       " Document(page_content='\"Definitions Term Definition CF A CF, known as an ETF for Consumer accounts, is a fee charged for those who cancel service before completing the contractual agreement made with AT&T at the time of activation or upgrade. Contracted CRUs, attached to a FAN, are subject to a CF when cancelling service before completion of their contractual agreement, unless a CF waiver is specified in their ROME/FaST profile OE. Commitment Start Date The date that the subscriber\\'s contract for that line of service is in effect. Do not confuse this with the Agreement start date. Custom CF Schedule A specific dollar amount that differs from the standard CF amount. Designate a specific flat CF dollar amount at the agreement or FAN level (e.g., $300 instead of $325). This cannot be designated at the device or CTN level. Designate a declining CF schedule agreement (e.g., $350 that declines at $12 per month instead of $10 per month; $150 declines at $6 per month instead of $4). Custom CF Waiver Waive all CFs for subscribers under that FAN and/or agreement. Custom CF Waiver with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per contract year (e.g., the first 300 lines cancelled per year receive waivers). Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN and/or agreement level. While not necessarily part of the contract language, a customer may request CF waivers be allocated to one FAN or spread across multiple FANs (i.e., 300 on one FAN, or 150/100/50 on three FANs; additional FANs could be assigned zero waivers). Waive fee accumulator counters are reset annually on the OE effective date. ILC Subscribers ILC for a single CTN. OE Effective Date A user-defined field in ROME meant to reflect the CF effective date in the contract language. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. Use this date when resetting the Custom CF Waiver with max lines count each year. An OE effective date defaults to date the OE is created but it is not a required field in ROME and it can be changed. Systematically, OEs go into effect on the OE Trigger start date regardless of the OE effective date. OE Expiration Date A user-defined field in ROME. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. The date that an OE expires in ROME. OE Trigger Expiration Date The date an OE expires and stops functioning. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF Schedules/Waivers. OE Trigger Start Date The date that an OE is added and inherited to the FAN level. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF schedules and resetting the annual Max Line count. Waive all CF without Condition Waive all CF without Condition is the same as Custom CF Waiver. CF Schedule A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. The fee schedule is based on the OE Trigger date. Using the OE Trigger Date and OE Effective Date, TLG uses the following rules when determining the CF. Upon subscriber cancellation, each CTN\\'s CF is evaluated based on both rules:  The OE Trigger Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Trigger Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. The OE Effective Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. Example: If a CF Waiver OE has an effective date of February 1, 2017, then the CF is waived for any lines that activated or upgraded on or after February 1, 2017, regardless of their cancellation date. OE Trigger Date vs. OE Effective Date Grid OE Trigger Date OE Effective Date TLG uses the OE Trigger Date to establish the CF Schedule User defined field for CF Schedule meant to reflect the contract language (systematically TLG uses the Trigger Date). Hidden to end-users - Not visible in ROME or TLG OEs go into effect the date they are added, regardless of the OE Effective date indicated OE Effective Date defaults to today\\'s date but is not a required field in ROME and is changeable TLG maintains a history of previous schedules, but it is not visible to users. A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. For any CRU with a FAN where there is no CF Schedule defined, TLG uses the default-declining schedule. CF Waiver (Flat Waiver) CFs for subscribers who activate or upgrade after the date the waiver is added. Customers with CF waivers under their FAN and/or agreement receive the waiver regardless of the date they activated or upgraded. Example: If a CF waiver was added on June 1, 2017, a line activated May 31, 2017, would receive the same waiver as a line activated June 1, 2017. CF Waivers with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per agreement and/or FAN per contract year. Some Enterprise contracts have customized CF options as part of their contract, which allow a waiver of the CF for a limit of lines per contract. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows the total amount number of CF waivers the customer has received, the number they have used so far, and the number remaining. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line returns to their available waivers. CF Waivers with Max Lines is a specific type of Waiver OE. Generally, the OE name should indicate Waive Cancellation Fee for [XXX] CRU users per year. Waivers with Max Lines will waive the CF for a defined number of CTNs and then apply a CF to all remaining CTNs. Example: The first 10 users have their fees waived and the 11th cancellation and all additional lines are charged a CF. The line limit applies per year. The count is reset each year on the OF Effective Date. Waivers with Max Lines can be at the FAN level or Agreement level.  Max Lines per Year Agreement: The waiver is at the Agreement level, so you would search by the contract ID. Max Lines per Year Profile: The waiver is at the Profile level, so you would search by the FAN. When the MAX Lines condition is added to a FAN/agreement, all subscribers will be counted against the Max Lines value. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows:  Waive Max Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer is allowed. Used Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has used this year. Left Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has remaining this year To access the screen in TLG, use the following path: Topics > Waiver Accumulator Info.  Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN/Profile level or Agreement level. Check FaST profile Offer Elements (OE) to determine the level settings: the Profile level or Agreement level Based on the OE criteria: \\uf0a7 If the waiver is at the Agreement level, search by the Agreement ID by entering the Agreement number into the Contract ID field of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG \\uf0a7 If the waiver is at the Profile level, search by the FAN ID by entering the FAN number into FAN ID of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG Click Get TLG uses the Waive CF OE Effective Date to perform the annual reset of the Max Line count. If a contract with Waiver with Max Lines is in effect for multiple years, no changes need to be made in ROME, and it resets in TLG at the annual anniversary of the OE Effective Date.  This means if the Waiver with Max Lines was set on June 21, 2015, and reset June 21, 2016, then it is reset again on June 21, 2017, assuming no changes have been made to the agreement. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line, returns to their available waiver.\",Unnamed: 1', metadata={'source': '/Users/clara_zang/Documents/Planning2023/Cognitive_AI/Care/After_September/BS4-html-preprocessing/MSS_000002692_20230917_2236uf.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'attributes_type': 'Knowledge__kav', 'attributes_url': '/services/data/v55.0/sobjects/Knowledge__kav/ka04M000000WU9RQAW', 'document_id': 'ka04M000000WU9RQAW', 'ArticleNumber': '000002692', 'Title': 'Early Termination Fees (ETFs) - Mobility', 'UrlName': 'early-termination-fees-et-fs---mobility', 'articleUrl': 'https://attone.my.salesforce.com/lightning/articles/Knowledge/early-termination-fees-et-fs---mobility', 'PublishStatus': 'Published', 'ArticleSummary': 'We bill an early termination fee (ETF) to customers who cancel service prior to completing the contractual agreement made with AT&amp;T.', 'Header 1': 'CRU\\n'}),\n",

We are no longer required to apply Puerto Rico specific ETF declining schedule amounts to $0 over the life of the contract; the Puerto Rico law that previously required this was amended in February 2018. As a result, we no longer perform any manual calculation for Puerto Rico ETF charges, and Puerto Rico customers are now subject to the normal ETF declining schedule. While AT&T already declines ETFs, the current monthly rate ($10 for Advanced and $4 for Standard) did not satisfy the Puerto Rico law (Law 157 - 2013) requiring all wireless ETFs to decline evenly to $0. Declining ETF rates for Puerto Rico apply to all consumer and business customers with a new AT&T wireless service contract. The ETF rates apply only to customers with a Puerto Rico CTN and billing address, not U.S. Virgin Island (USVI) customers.

      " Suggested Verbiage :  At AT&T, we work hard every day to provide you with a great wireless experience at competitive prices. One of the ways we do this is to offer you the industry's leading wireless handsets below their full-retail price when you sign a two-year service agreement. In the event you wish to cancel service before your two-year agreement expires, you agree to pay a prorated early termination fee as an alternative way to complete your agreement. Of course, if you prefer not to enter into a term commitment, we offer the same great selection of devices at their full retail price with no term commitment or ETF, as well as AT&T PREPAID options. \n",
      "   An ETF is another way to fulfill a service commitment - it's not a penalty. Once the service commitment is complete, there's no ETF to cancel service. The ETF amount depends on the type of device purchased and how much of the service commitment is completed at the time of cancellation. I would love the opportunity to discuss what we could do to encourage you to stay with AT&T and to show you all of the new and competitive services we can offer.\n",

      "\"ETF Types Advanced Devices Unless a higher fee is specified in your business agreement, the ETF starts at $325 and goes down by $10/mo. for the term of the agreement for Advanced category purchased devices (includes all smartphones purchased with a service agreement).  Standard Devices The ETF starts at $150 and goes down by $4/mo. for the term of the agreement for purchased Standard devices (includes non-smartphone devices that have SIM card, e.g., basic and quick messaging phones [QMPs], LaptopConnect cards, WHP, Mobile Internet Device, Mobile Hotspot, connected wearables, and tablets). To determine if equipment is an Advanced device, reference Understand Early Termination Fees. Declining ETFs may also be referred to as a Prorated ETF. How to Identify the ETF Rate For Telegence: From the Agreement tab, click Commitment. The ETF Rate displays on the Commitment window. To view the declining ETF schedule, click Additional Contract Details. For OPUS: Refer to Consumer Tab > Billing and Payments > View Early Termination Fee onthe OPUS Hub.  For CRU: Review the customer's FAN profile to determine the applicable ETF policy and fee. If the Offer Element (OE) is listed in FaST, and a customer is charged an ETF, submit a correct charge adjustment to resolve. If a CRU line disconnects before the end of its initial line commitment (ILC), the CF is charged to the billing account.  Line CFs do not coincide with the national contract. Customers are not allowed to pick and choose when to use the ETF waivers.  ETF waivers are used in the order the actual cancellation is completed. For future dated cancellations, any requests processed prior to that date would impact the availability of the waivers. For Important Information and Troubleshooting see CRU section.

      "\"Definitions Term Definition CF A CF, known as an ETF for Consumer accounts, is a fee charged for those who cancel service before completing the contractual agreement made with AT&T at the time of activation or upgrade. Contracted CRUs, attached to a FAN, are subject to a CF when cancelling service before completion of their contractual agreement, unless a CF waiver is specified in their ROME/FaST profile OE. Commitment Start Date The date that the subscriber's contract for that line of service is in effect. Do not confuse this with the Agreement start date. Custom CF Schedule A specific dollar amount that differs from the standard CF amount. Designate a specific flat CF dollar amount at the agreement or FAN level (e.g., $300 instead of $325). This cannot be designated at the device or CTN level. Designate a declining CF schedule agreement (e.g., $350 that declines at $12 per month instead of $10 per month; $150 declines at $6 per month instead of $4). Custom CF Waiver Waive all CFs for subscribers under that FAN and/or agreement. Custom CF Waiver with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per contract year (e.g., the first 300 lines cancelled per year receive waivers). Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN and/or agreement level. While not necessarily part of the contract language, a customer may request CF waivers be allocated to one FAN or spread across multiple FANs (i.e., 300 on one FAN, or 150/100/50 on three FANs; additional FANs could be assigned zero waivers). Waive fee accumulator counters are reset annually on the OE effective date. ILC Subscribers ILC for a single CTN. OE Effective Date A user-defined field in ROME meant to reflect the CF effective date in the contract language. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. Use this date when resetting the Custom CF Waiver with max lines count each year. An OE effective date defaults to date the OE is created but it is not a required field in ROME and it can be changed. Systematically, OEs go into effect on the OE Trigger start date regardless of the OE effective date. OE Expiration Date A user-defined field in ROME. Visible to users in ROME/FaST. The date that an OE expires in ROME. OE Trigger Expiration Date The date an OE expires and stops functioning. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF Schedules/Waivers. OE Trigger Start Date The date that an OE is added and inherited to the FAN level. This field is not visible to users. This date is critical to TLG when establishing CF schedules and resetting the annual Max Line count. Waive all CF without Condition Waive all CF without Condition is the same as Custom CF Waiver. CF Schedule A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. The fee schedule is based on the OE Trigger date. Using the OE Trigger Date and OE Effective Date, TLG uses the following rules when determining the CF. Upon subscriber cancellation, each CTN's CF is evaluated based on both rules:  The OE Trigger Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Trigger Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. The OE Effective Date must be before the CTN Commitment Start Date (activation or upgrade date) and OE Expiration Date must be after the CTN Commitment Start Date. Example: If a CF Waiver OE has an effective date of February 1, 2017, then the CF is waived for any lines that activated or upgraded on or after February 1, 2017, regardless of their cancellation date. OE Trigger Date vs. OE Effective Date Grid OE Trigger Date OE Effective Date TLG uses the OE Trigger Date to establish the CF Schedule User defined field for CF Schedule meant to reflect the contract language (systematically TLG uses the Trigger Date). Hidden to end-users - Not visible in ROME or TLG OEs go into effect the date they are added, regardless of the OE Effective date indicated OE Effective Date defaults to today's date but is not a required field in ROME and is changeable TLG maintains a history of previous schedules, but it is not visible to users. A custom contract can define a customized flat fee or declining schedule. For any CRU with a FAN where there is no CF Schedule defined, TLG uses the default-declining schedule. CF Waiver (Flat Waiver) CFs for subscribers who activate or upgrade after the date the waiver is added. Customers with CF waivers under their FAN and/or agreement receive the waiver regardless of the date they activated or upgraded. Example: If a CF waiver was added on June 1, 2017, a line activated May 31, 2017, would receive the same waiver as a line activated June 1, 2017. CF Waivers with Max Lines Waive a fixed number of CFs per agreement and/or FAN per contract year. Some Enterprise contracts have customized CF options as part of their contract, which allow a waiver of the CF for a limit of lines per contract. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows the total amount number of CF waivers the customer has received, the number they have used so far, and the number remaining. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line returns to their available waivers. CF Waivers with Max Lines is a specific type of Waiver OE. Generally, the OE name should indicate Waive Cancellation Fee for [XXX] CRU users per year. Waivers with Max Lines will waive the CF for a defined number of CTNs and then apply a CF to all remaining CTNs. Example: The first 10 users have their fees waived and the 11th cancellation and all additional lines are charged a CF. The line limit applies per year. The count is reset each year on the OF Effective Date. Waivers with Max Lines can be at the FAN level or Agreement level.  Max Lines per Year Agreement: The waiver is at the Agreement level, so you would search by the contract ID. Max Lines per Year Profile: The waiver is at the Profile level, so you would search by the FAN. When the MAX Lines condition is added to a FAN/agreement, all subscribers will be counted against the Max Lines value. The Waive Accumulator Information screen shows:  Waive Max Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer is allowed. Used Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has used this year. Left Lines: The number of CF waivers the customer has remaining this year To access the screen in TLG, use the following path: Topics > Waiver Accumulator Info.  Waivers with Max Lines can be set at the FAN/Profile level or Agreement level. Check FaST profile Offer Elements (OE) to determine the level settings: the Profile level or Agreement level Based on the OE criteria:  If the waiver is at the Agreement level, search by the Agreement ID by entering the Agreement number into the Contract ID field of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG  If the waiver is at the Profile level, search by the FAN ID by entering the FAN number into FAN ID of Waiver Accumulator Info in TLG Click Get TLG uses the Waive CF OE Effective Date to perform the annual reset of the Max Line count. If a contract with Waiver with Max Lines is in effect for multiple years, no changes need to be made in ROME, and it resets in TLG at the annual anniversary of the OE Effective Date.  This means if the Waiver with Max Lines was set on June 21, 2015, and reset June 21, 2016, then it is reset again on June 21, 2017, assuming no changes have been made to the agreement. When a customer resumes a previously cancelled line that received a CF waiver, the CF waiver that was used by that line, returns to their available waiver.\",Unnamed: 1\n",

      " \"Customer Care Can HS-Consumer Sales offer new wireless customers devices, AirCards, and netbooks from AT&T without a term agreement? Not at this time; refer the customer to an AT&T store. The Consumer wired channel's rate plans and prices are based on the customer agreeing to a two-year commitment; however, customers may opt to purchase at full-retail price and no ETF will apply.\"\n",
      "\"Puerto Rico Do Puerto Rico customers have a special rate of decline for ETF? We are no longer required to apply Puerto Rico specific ETF declining schedule amounts to $0 over the life of the contract; the Puerto Rico law that previously required this was amended in February 2018. As a result, we no longer perform any manual calculation for Puerto Rico ETF charges, and Puerto Rico customers are now subject to the normal ETF declining schedule. While AT&T already declines ETFs, the current monthly rate ($10 for Advanced and $4 for Standard) did not satisfy the Puerto Rico law (Law 157 - 2013) requiring all wireless ETFs to decline evenly to $0. Declining ETF rates for Puerto Rico apply to all consumer and business customers with a new AT&T wireless service contract. The ETF rates apply only to customers with a Puerto Rico CTN and billing address, not U.S. Virgin Island (USVI) customers. All mobility consumer customers have the same ETF ($325 for Advanced and $150 for Standard); the back-end process used for customers cancelling in Puerto Rico is no longer in effect.\"\n",
      "\"CRU What happens if the customer thinks they should be getting a CF waiver, and they are not? Before denying an adjustment, reps check the company's profile in FaST to determine if a customer's contract has an OE that allows a waiver of ETFs. Refer the requestor to their Pricing Manager.\"\n",

      "\"If the fee indicates $325 declining, and the customer believes it should be $175 declining, what happens if the customer believes the amount of the fee is incorrect? Explain to the customer the facts of their CF schedule. Review the commitment start date in TLG. The CF schedule that was in effect on the subscriber's commitment start date determines which CF schedule applies.\"\n",
      "What happens when a subscriber does a FAN Move and is the CF assessed based on OEs established on the old FAN or the new FAN? The CF is assessed based on the OEs established on the new FAN. The CF schedule that was in effect on the subscriber's commitment start date determines which CF schedule applies.\n",
      "\"Can one subscriber's CF experience differ from another subscriber's CF experience under the same FAN, and does the CF experience differ for existing customers vs. new customers? Yes, the CF schedule that was in effect on each subscriber's commitment start date determines which CF schedule applies.\"\n",
